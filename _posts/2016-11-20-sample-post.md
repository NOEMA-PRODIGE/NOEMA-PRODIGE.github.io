# PRODIGE (PROtostars and DIsks: Global Evolution) -- A NOEMA MPG-IRAM Large Program 

PRODIGE is a survey of 32 very young Class 0/I protostars in the Perseus Molecular Cloud (PI P. Caselli) as well as 8 more-evolved Class II protoplanetary disks in the Taurus Molecular Cloud (PI Th. Henning).  We use the powerful, wideband observations from the NOEMA interferometer to study the angular momentum, density, temperature, turbulence, and chemical compositions of protostars and pre-main-sequence stars during the evolutionary eras where planet formation begins.  At the conclusion of our survey (late 2025 or early 2026), science ready data products will be publically released for over 7 million individual frequency channels.
